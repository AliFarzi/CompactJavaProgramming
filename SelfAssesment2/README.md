# SelfAssesment2 - Industrial Process Simulation

This project simulates an industrial process involving Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) and operations. It demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts in Java.

## Files

- **app.java**  
  Main entry point. Simulates three industrial processes, prints process duration, required AGVs, and total energy consumption.

- **IndustrialProcess.java**  
  Represents an industrial process with a list of operations. Calculates total process duration and required AGVs.

- **IOperation.java**  
  Represents an operation in the process. Assigns AGVs and calculates energy consumption.

- **AGV.java**  
  Represents an Automated Guided Vehicle with properties like battery load, consumption, and speed.
